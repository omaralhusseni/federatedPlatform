# Federated Data Integration Platform

## 📌 Problem

Our Organiziation often rely on multiple systems (e.g., **Royal Raptors**, **Arkan**, and others), each built with different **tech stacks**, **databases**, and **design paradigms**.  
This fragmentation creates several challenges:

- No unified way to **discover available data** or APIs across systems.
- Developers must learn each system’s **unique API contract**.
- Cross-system **analytics and reporting** require custom integrations.
- Inconsistent **naming conventions**, **schemas**, and **auth mechanisms**.
- High overhead when **adding or modifying integrations**.

As a result, data silos slow down decision-making and make cross-platform insights costly and time-consuming.

## ✅ Solution

We propose a **federated integration platform** that standardizes how systems expose their data and operations.

### Key Features

1. **`/expose` Endpoint in Each System**

   - Returns a **self-describing JSON schema** of available routes, input/output types, and methods.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "routes": [
         {
           "path": "/users",
           "methods": ["GET", "POST"],
           "output_schema": [{ "t": "int", "name": "add_data" }],
           "input_schema": [
             {
               "name": "add_data",
               "t": "post",
               "required_data": [{ "name": "email", "t": "string" }]
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

2. **Central Orchestrator**

   - Periodically collects `/expose` data from all systems.
   - Maintains a **service registry** with all available APIs and their schemas.

3. **Normalization Layer**

   - Maps inconsistent schemas (e.g., `user_id` vs `customerId`) to a **canonical data model**.
   - Ensures consistency for queries and analytics.

4. **Unified Interface**
   - A single API/UI for:
     - Querying across systems
     - Adding new data
     - Running **statistical analyses** and generating reports

## 🛠 Tech Analysis

### System Requirements

- **Adapters in Each System**

  - Implement `/expose` endpoints using JSON Schema or OpenAPI.
  - Authentication with API keys or JWTs.

- **Orchestration Layer**

  - Registry of systems & routes (Postgres or MongoDB).
  - API Gateway to route user requests to underlying systems.
  - Scheduler to refresh `/expose` definitions.

- **UI Layer**
  - Dashboard in **React** + **Node.js backend**.
  - Features: schema explorer, query builder, analytics dashboards.

| Phase                             | Tasks                                                             | Duration      |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **1. Requirements & Design**      | Define `/expose` spec, choose schema standard, design registry DB | **3 days** |
| **2. Adapters**                   | Add `/expose` endpoint to Royal Raptors, Arkan, and 1 more system | **1 week** |
| **3. Orchestrator MVP**           | Build registry service, API gateway, basic schema fetcher         | **2 weeks** |
| **5. Unified Interface (API/UI)** | React dashboard, query builder, analytics tools                   | **2 weeks** |
| **6. implementation in systems**      | End-to-end tests, security, performance optimizations             | **2 weeks**   |

| **6. Testing & Deployment**       | End-to-end tests, security, performance optimizations             | **2 weeks**   |

**Total Estimate:** ~ **1–2 months** for a working MVP with 3 integrated systems.
