# Federated Data Integration Platform

## üìå Problem

Our Organiziation often rely on multiple systems (e.g., **Royal Raptors**, **Arkan**, and others), each built with different **tech stacks**, **databases**, and **design paradigms**.  
This fragmentation creates several challenges:

- No unified way to **discover available data** or APIs across systems.
- Developers must learn each system‚Äôs **unique API contract**.
- Cross-system **analytics and reporting** require custom integrations.
- Inconsistent **naming conventions**, **schemas**, and **auth mechanisms**.
- High overhead when **adding or modifying integrations**.

As a result, data silos slow down decision-making and make cross-platform insights costly and time-consuming.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

We propose a **federated integration platform** that standardizes how systems expose their data and operations.

### Key Features

1. **`/expose` Endpoint in Each System**

   - Returns a **self-describing JSON schema** of available routes, input/output types, and methods.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "routes": [
         {
           "path": "/users",
           "methods": ["GET", "POST"],
           "output_schema": [{ "t": "int", "name": "add_data" }],
           "input_schema": [
             {
               "name": "add_data",
               "t": "post",
               "required_data": [{ "name": "email", "t": "string" }]
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

2. **Central Orchestrator**

   - Periodically collects `/expose` data from all systems.
   - Maintains a **service registry** with all available APIs and their schemas.

3. **Normalization Layer**

   - Maps inconsistent schemas (e.g., `user_id` vs `customerId`) to a **canonical data model**.
   - Ensures consistency for queries and analytics.

4. **Unified Interface**
   - A single API/UI for:
     - Querying across systems
     - Adding new data
     - Running **statistical analyses** and generating reports

## üõ† Tech Analysis

### System Requirements

- **Adapters in Each System**

  - Implement `/expose` endpoints using JSON Schema or OpenAPI.
  - Authentication with API keys or JWTs.

- **Orchestration Layer**

  - Registry of systems & routes (Postgres or MongoDB).
  - API Gateway to route user requests to underlying systems.
  - Scheduler to refresh `/expose` definitions.

- **UI Layer**
  - Dashboard in **React** + **Node.js backend**.
  - Features: schema explorer, query builder, analytics dashboards.

## üÜö Federated vs. Centralized Monolith

When solving cross-system data fragmentation, there are two main strategies:

### 1. Federated Approach
Each system remains independent but exposes a standardized `/expose` endpoint.  
The platform acts as an **orchestrator** that unifies discovery, querying, and analytics.

**Pros**
- ‚úÖ **Low disruption**: Existing systems keep running as-is.  
- ‚úÖ **Incremental adoption**: Integrate one system at a time.  
- ‚úÖ **Autonomy**: Teams can evolve their own stacks independently.  
- ‚úÖ **Scalability**: Easy to plug in new systems without rewriting.  
- ‚úÖ **Faster MVP**: Working prototype in weeks/months.  

**Cons**
- ‚ùå **Schema drift**: Underlying systems may change APIs, requiring updates.  
- ‚ùå **Complex orchestration**: Requires a strong normalization layer.  
- ‚ùå **Performance bottlenecks**: Queries may be slower if they span multiple live systems.  

---

### 2. Centralized Monolith Approach
Rebuild or migrate all systems into **one unified platform** with a single database, API, and data model.

**Pros**
- ‚úÖ **Single source of truth**: No schema mismatches or duplication.  
- ‚úÖ **Simplicity**: Easier to build analytics, since all data lives in one place.  
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Faster queries and transactions.  
- ‚úÖ **Consistent UX**: Every feature runs on the same stack.  

**Cons**
- ‚ùå **Huge rewrite cost**: Rebuilding multiple systems takes years, not months.  
- ‚ùå **Risky migration**: Potential downtime and data loss during consolidation.  
- ‚ùå **Loss of autonomy**: All teams now tied to one tech stack.  
- ‚ùå **Scalability limits**: Monolith may struggle as features and domains expand.  
- ‚ùå **Innovation bottleneck**: Any change requires coordination across all domains.

### üîë Decision Factors
- **Timeline**: Need results in months? ‚Üí Federated.  
- **Resources**: Have years + large dev team? ‚Üí Monolith may be possible.  
- **Flexibility**: Want to plug in many different vendors/systems? ‚Üí Federated.  
- **Consistency**: Want total control and standardization? ‚Üí Monolith.

### üèÜ Recommended Path
Start **federated** to deliver quick wins and cross-system analytics.  
If long-term strategy demands, gradually **merge** core domains into a central system ‚Äî but only after proving business value with federation.
